    MPL3115A2 Barometric Pressure and Tempurature Sensor Library
    By: Michael Lange
    Date: March 31, 2014
    License: This code is public domain.
 
    This class wraps the functions of the MPL3115A2 sensor into 
    a usable class that exposes most functions to your project.
    Functions that are not exposed can easily be added using the
    existing functions in this library. Specifically, I did not
    add any funtions to handle FIFO logging or the use of either
    of the pin interrupts. This should not be too difficult to
    add if you need those features.
    
    The motivation here was to get a set of support classes 
    together that supported the chip and could be expanded on.
    With this library you can extract all relevant data from the
    sensor.
    
    Be sure to download the DATASHEET and the App Note AN4519.
    
    This library was created using the mbed NXP LPC11U24. Pins
    p27 and p28 were used for the I2C functions. Be sure to install
    1K pull-up resistors on both lines. Also, if you're not using
    the SparkFun breakout board, be sure to use the right caps on 
    the power pin. If you don't, the jitter can cause problems.
    
    This library was inspired by the similar library available for
    the Arduino written by Nathan Seidle at SparkFun. I copied
    some of the number crunching routines and tried to follow his
    style of coding for the library. That way users of Arduinos
    could step into this library a little easier.
